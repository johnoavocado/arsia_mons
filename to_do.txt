// TO DO LIST
Check Number of occupations against list of occupations!
    And m_functions!
Change the probabilities of each job
    Work on random occupation
    definitely have a medic/engineer/researcher/journalist
    the rest are trimmings
Robot surnames
    Mkii
    v0.1
Fix WhichLabs()
    static for how many labs there are
    No need to set beyond max_prescribed. SHELL is fine. Leave it up to the ENGINEERs.
